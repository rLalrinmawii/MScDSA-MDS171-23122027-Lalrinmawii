    "## My Menu Driven Restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "In the charming little town named \"Culinary Haven\", there stood a restaurant called \"The Enchanted Fork\". This restaurant was more than just a place to eat; it was a magical experience that left a lasting impression on all who visited. The restaurant is also famous for its management application that takes up customer orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software collects the order details for the customers. The application generates a unique orderid for each order based on the below specifications. The software system has a predefined menu of items and their prices, from which the user can select them.\n",
    "\n",
    "OrderID is created with the help of a combination of 5 random numbers generated with the help of a random library in Python. You can use random.randint() function to get one random integer at a time and the order id is generated by concatenating five such numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from orderid, each order will have the items ordered and their quantity saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application has the following options in its menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new order        \n",
    "View Orders (List and calculate the bill for each order)       \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:       \n",
    "Each order will have a unique orderID generated as per the specifications given.\n",
    "Each order can have multiple items.        \n",
    "Once the order is completed, you may calculate the total order value             \n",
    "You can set a predefined menu and price for the items       \n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations:\n",
    "Identify the appropriate data storage mechanisms to store the order data effectively.           \n",
    "Usage of functions      \n",
    "menu items stored in the format: [[\"Rice\",30],[\"Tea\",10],.....]             \n",
